# Mouse Wrapping
Single files that make your mouse go to the other side of the screen when it touches a border<br>
Works based on the *virtual screen space*... works with multiple monitors.<br>
Works on windows(Win32), requires python and possibly pip to work if you want to use the python version.<br>
Otherwise, there's a C version, and a compiled executable.<br>
Has to be re-opened if you change your monitor setup<br>
